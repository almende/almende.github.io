NETS

Nets contains all algorithms developed at Almende. Our algorithms are tailored for 
applications that have to do with networks. Networks (or nets) of humans, machines,
or (slightly exaggerated) neurons. Our research concerns the use of local mechanisms
to bring about global behaviour. However, besides that we also develop standard or
state-of-the-art techniques that have to do with concrete practical problems of 
machine learning, artificial intelligence, and networks of sensors, smartphones, and
robots.
